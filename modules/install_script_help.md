# Installation Scripts notes

## General

The install scripts for each module will be contained in `install.sh` for Linux/macOS, and `install.bat`
for windows. These two variations mirror each other in form and variable naming.

The install scripts are call via the main `setup.sh`/`setup.bat` script. 

If `setup` is called from the `/src` folder then it runs in 'Development Environment setup' mode, 
meaning it sets up the entire environment in preparation for coding and debugging. .NET is installed,
folders are created, and every module in the /src/modules folder is setup by calling each module's 
`install` script in turn. The demo modules in the /src/demos will then be setup.

If the `setup` script is called from within a module's home directory (via `bash ../../setup.sh` or
`..\..\setup.bat`) then the setup script operates in 'Install module' mode, meaning it will only run
the necessary commands to setup the current module.

## Module Setup Lifecycle

Regardless of whether the setup script is running in dev or install mode, it will carry out the same 
steps when installing a single module or all modules.

1. The setup life cycle starts be detecting the current environment. The Operating system, whether it's
Intel x64 or arm64 architecture, the presence of known GPUs, the type of system (eg Jetson or 
Raspberry Pi, or just plain Windows), and the environment (eg Docker, WSL, or native).

2. The module's `modulesettings.json` file is then read to determine the module's runtime. If the module
uses Python then the version of python given by the `runtime` setting will be installed and a virtual
environment setup.

3. If no errors occurred, the module's `install` script will be run

4. If no errors occurred, and if the module uses Python and has an appropriate requirements.txt file,
the packages in the requirements.txt file will be installed.

5. If no errors occurred, and if the module has a `post_install.sh` / `postinstall.bat` file then this
script will be run

## Module Requirements file

There is no "one-size-fits-all" for python packages. The Operating system, 
hardware, libraries, the version of Python and many more things factor into what
packages can and should be installed.

To provide full coverage for all the possibilities there are two tactics. First,
you can install python modules directly via the `install` script. The `installPythonPackagesByName` provides an easy way to achieve this.

Second, you can provide system specific `requirements.txt` files, with the installer
choosing the correct one at install time. The files are named based on device,
OS, architecture, GPU type, and optionally CUDA library type.

The order of preference for choosing a requirements file is as follows.

 - requirements.device.txt                            (device = raspberrypi, orangepi, radxarock, jetson)
 - requirements.os.architecture.cudaMajor_Minor.txt   (eg cuda12_0)
 - requirements.os.architecture.cudaMajor.txt         (eg cuda12)
 - requirements.os.architecture.(cuda|rocm).txt
 - requirements.os.cudaMajor_Minor.txt
 - requirements.os.cudaMajor.txt
 - requirements.os.(cuda|rocm).txt
 - requirements.cudaMajor_Minor.txt
 - requirements.cudaMajor.txt
 - requirements.(cuda|rocm).txt
 - requirements.os.architecture.gpu.txt
 - requirements.os.gpu.txt
 - requirements.gpu.txt
 - requirements.os.architecture.txt
 - requirements.os.txt
 - requirements.txt

"device" is one of "raspberrypi", "orangepi", "radxarock" or "jetson". "cudaMajor_Minor" is the major/minor version of CUDA currently installed (eg 12.2). "cudaMajor" is just the major version (eg 12). "rocm" refers to AMD ROCm GPU support, and "gpu" is a generic identifier meaning "use if GPU support is enabled, but no
CUDA or ROCm GPUs have been detected". This is great for packages that support
multiple GPUs such as OpenVINO and DirectML.

As an example, `requirements.linux.arm64.cuda11_7.txt` would be a requirements file specifically for Linux on arm64 systems, targeting CUDA 11.7. `requirements.windows.gpu.txt` would be for targeting Windows where a GPU was found. If, in this case, no GPU was found but there was a `requirements.windows.txt` file, then that would be used as a fallback. It's wise to always provide a generic, safe `requirements.txt` fallback.
